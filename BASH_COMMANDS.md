# BASH COMMANDS
**these are some bash commands that I use pretty often**\
**...and I hope you will find them useful too**

**for detailed syntax, read manuals - `man`**

* `cd` - duh...
* `cat` or `more` This will let you read any text file from the terminal
* `rm` to delete files, `-r` to delete directories, `-f` to force delete
* `mv [source_file] [target_diretory]` to move the file to target directory
* `cp` much like `mv`, but instead of cut-paste, does copy-paste
* `mkdir` - duh
